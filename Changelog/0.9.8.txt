SpeechMod 

Version 0.9.8 Changelog

- Added support for Mac OSX, using the installed voices in OSX! No longer Windows only! (I guess only Linux remains)
- Added testing of selected voice in the settings.
- Added Windows only setting to control if pressing a playback should queue it or interrupt the current playback. (For OSX it interrupts it)
- Various slight optimizations and stability fixes.
