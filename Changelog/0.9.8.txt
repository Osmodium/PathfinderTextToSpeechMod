SpeechMod 

Version 0.9.8 Changelog

- Added support for macOS, using the voices available through the 'say' command! No longer Windows only woo! (I guess only Linux remains)

- Added Auto play feature, of dialogs when it's not voice acted.
- Removed ability to queue playback, playing any TTS will interrupt the current playback.
- Various slight optimizations and stability fixes.
