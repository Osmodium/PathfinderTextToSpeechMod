SpeechMod 

Version 1.0.0 Changelog

- Added Auto play feature, of dialogs when it's not voice acted. I guess it can be called synthetic voice acting.
- Added gender specific voices for dialog feature, with individual voice rate, pitch and volume where available.
- Added text and button to preview the selected voice in the settings.
- Added support for macOS, using the voices available through the 'say' command! No longer Windows only woo! (I guess only Linux remains)
- Various slight optimizations and stability fixes.
