### Known issues / limitations

*If you find issues or would like to request features, please use the issues tracker in GitHub [here](https://github.com/Osmodium/PathfinderTextToSpeechMod/issues)*

#### Limitations:
 - Only works on Windows, since it utilizes the built-in accessibility tool "SAPI" in Windows.
 - There's currently a bug in the base game where sub-menus in the Encyclopedia disappears at times, this is not due to this mod.

#### Issues todo:
 - Pressing multiple times queues the text to be spoken after the current one has played through.
 - No stopping of voice.
 - No support for chapter changes (although they seem to be narrated).
 - No support for tutorial popups.

### How to use

#### 1) Dialog 
When in dialog mode you can now press the play button next to the left image to listen to the current block of dialog.

When inspecting an item (through *right-click->Info*) *hover* over text (not all text is currently supported) and *left click*.

![Some of the texts are not supported yet. Try hovering different parts to see which are supported](http://www.dashvoid.com/speechmod/itemtext.png)

#### 4) Journal Quest text
In the journal, each of the bigger text blocks and important stuff can be played through the play button adjacent to the text.

#### 5) Encyclopedia text
In the encyclopedia the text blocks (defined by Owlcat) can be played by pressing the play button adjacent to the text.

#### 6) Book Event text
When encountering a book event, the text can be played by hovering the text part (it will apply the chosen hover effect) and left-clicking.

#### 7) Messagebox text
The various pop-up boxes that eventually shows up throughout the game, can be played when hovered and left-clicked.

### Settings

The different settings (available through *ctrl+f10* if not overridden in the UMM) for SpeechMod
- **Speech rate**: The speed of the voice the higher number, the faster the speech. From -10 to 10, 1 is default.
- **Speech volume**: The volume of the voice from 0 to 100.
- **Speech pitch**: The pitch of the voice from -10 to 10.
- **Voice**: Select from the three Microsoft built-in voices available.
- **Enable color on hover**: This is used only for the text boxes when inspecting items, and colors the text the selected color when hovering the text box.
- **Enable font style on hover**: As above this is only used for text boxes, but lets you set the style of the font.
- **Phonetic Dictionary Reload**: Reloads the PhoneticDictionary.json into the game, to facilitate modificaton while playing.

### Motivation
*Why did I create this mod?*
I have come to realize that I spend alot of my energy through the day on various activities, so when I get to play a game I rarely have enough energy left over to focus on reading long passages of text. So I thought it nice if I could get a helping hand so I wouldn't miss out on the excellent stories and writing in text heavy games.
After I started creating this mod, I have thought to myself that if I struggle with this issue, imageine what people with genuine disabilities must go through and possibly miss out on, which motivated me even more to get this mod working and release it. I really hope that it will help and encourage more people to get as much out of the game as possible.

### Contribute
If you find a name in the game which is pronounced funny by the voice, you can add it to the PhoneticDictionary.json in the mod folder (don't uninstall the mod as this will be deleted). I don't have a great way of submitting changes to this besides through GitHub pull requests, which is not super user friendly. But let's see if we can build a good pronounciation database for the voice together.
